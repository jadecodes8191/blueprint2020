The Spiciest Meme Bot

Non-ML (Java) version:
- Resources:

Machine Learning (Python) version:
This version of the code imports various libraries to scrape memes from the subreddit r/memes, read the words from within the images, train a machine learning model on the words, and generate new captions for memes. (We did not have time to add the captions back on to images)

Resources Used/Imported:
- PRAW (to scrape memes from Reddit)
- OpenCV (to read words from within images)
- GPT2-Simple (to train the language model and generate captions -- not only did we use this library, we learned how to do so by looking at the examples on the Github repo (https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) 
- Google Colaboratory (to increase the speed of training)
- Better Profanity (to censor inappropriate words from the memes)
- JSON Requests
